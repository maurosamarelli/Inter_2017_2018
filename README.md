# Inter_2017_2018
Data analysis about Football Club Internazionale season 2017-2018, i.e. when we came back to the UCL!

In this repository we handle [Wyscout](https://wyscout.com/) data and to extract useful information for the tactical point of view.

We use the [Player Rank](https://github.com/mesosbrodleto/playerank) open source project owned by Pappalardo Luca, Cintia Paolo & Co.
